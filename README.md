### Project Overview üîç
**ResQnect** is a disaster response management system designed to enhance the efficiency of relief operations. The system simplifies the coordination of volunteers, tracks essential resources like food and medical supplies, and assigns tasks to ensure organized disaster response efforts. With its streamlined interface, this enables users to manage volunteers, resources, and disaster-related tasks effectively. By facilitating clear communication and well-defined roles during emergencies, the system reduces delays and improves outcomes. Furthermore, it allows users to generate reports and analyze response times to continuously improve disaster readiness. The software is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring its modularity and maintainability. As communities face increasing risks from natural disasters, it serves as a tool to improve preparedness and resilience. Its ultimate goal is to empower local governments and organizations to save lives and resources during critical moments.

### Application of OOP Principles üõ†Ô∏è
In developing **ResQnect**, core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles were applied to create a modular and efficient system. Here's how each principle was implemented:

- **Encapsulation** üíä  
  In the code, data related to volunteers, resources, and tasks is stored in private attributes within classes like `Volunteer`, `Resource`, and `Task`. These private attributes are accessed and modified only through getter and setter methods, ensuring the integrity of the data. For example, the `Resource` class ensures that the quantity of items cannot be set to a negative value, protecting the data from invalid inputs.

- **Abstraction** üóÑÔ∏è  
  Complex operations are abstracted into separate classes like `VolunteerManager`, `ResourceManager`, and `TaskManager`. For instance, when adding a new volunteer, the user simply selects the "Manage Volunteers" option, and the `VolunteerManager` class handles the creation and storage of the volunteer. Users interact with a straightforward menu system, while the internal complexities of data processing are hidden.

- **Inheritance** üß¨  
  A base class `User` is used to define common properties such as `name`, `contact`, and `address`. The `Volunteer` class inherits from `User`, reducing redundant code and enabling shared methods to be reused. This structure allows for easy future expansion, such as adding other user roles like coordinators or responders.

- **Polymorphism** üìë  
  Polymorphism is utilized through overridden methods like `toString()`. For example, the `Volunteer` class overrides the `toString()` method to return detailed information about the volunteer, while the `Resource` class provides a different representation for its objects. This makes it easier to display relevant information based on the object type, improving user interaction.

### Integration with SDG üåç

</div>

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** focuses on building safe, inclusive, and resilient communities. **ResQnect** contributes to this goal in several ways:

1. **Preparedness**: Tracks and manages essential resources such as food, water, and medical supplies to ensure readiness for emergencies.  
2. **Efficient Response**: Organizes volunteers and assigns tasks systematically to reduce response time during disasters.  
3. **Data-Driven Improvements**: Analyzes disaster response data to refine strategies and enhance future disaster preparedness.  
4. **Community Support**: Strengthens local disaster management efforts by providing an easy-to-use system for relief coordination.

By aligning with SDG 11, **ResQnect** empowers communities to handle disasters more effectively, minimizing loss of life and damage.

### Running the Program üíª

To run the **ResQnect** system, follow these steps for a smooth experience:

1. **Prepare the Code Files**  
   - Save all the necessary Java files (e.g., `Volunteer.java`, `Resource.java`, `Task.java`, `DisasterResponseSystem.java`) in a single project folder.

2. **Compile the Program**  
   - Open your terminal or IDE, navigate to the project folder, and compile the main script:
     ```bash
     javac DisasterResponseSystem.java
     ```

3. **Execute the Program**  
   - Run the compiled program with:
     ```bash
     java DisasterResponseSystem
     ```

4. **Main Menu Options**  
   - After launching the program, you will be greeted with a menu offering the following options:
     - **1. Manage Volunteers**: Add, view, update, or delete volunteers.  
     - **2. Manage Resources**: Track resources like food, water, and medical supplies.  
     - **3. Assign Tasks**: Assign specific disaster response tasks to volunteers.  
     - **4. Track Tasks**: Monitor the progress of assigned tasks.  
     - **5. Response Time Reports**: Generate reports for analysis and future planning.  
     - **6. Exit**: Close the application safely.

5. **Perform Actions**  
   - Navigate through the menu by entering the corresponding number for each option. For instance, selecting **1** will allow you to manage volunteer information, such as adding a new volunteer with their details.

6. **Save and Exit**  
   - The program automatically saves data to files (e.g., `volunteers.json`, `resources.json`) to preserve it across sessions. Use the **Exit** option to terminate the application securely.

By following these steps, users can efficiently utilize **ResQnect** to prepare for and respond to disasters while maintaining organized records and reports.
