### Project Overview üîç
**ResQnect** is a disaster response management system designed to enhance the efficiency of relief operations. The system simplifies the coordination of volunteers, tracks essential resources like food and medical supplies, and assigns tasks to ensure organized disaster response efforts. With its streamlined interface, this enables users to manage volunteers, resources, and disaster-related tasks effectively. By facilitating clear communication and well-defined roles during emergencies, the system reduces delays and improves outcomes. Furthermore, it allows users to generate reports and analyze response times to continuously improve disaster readiness. The software is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring its modularity and maintainability. As communities face increasing risks from natural disasters, it serves as a tool to improve preparedness and resilience. Its ultimate goal is to empower local governments and organizations to save lives and resources during critical situations.

### Application of OOP Principles üõ†Ô∏è
In developing **ResQnect**, core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles were applied to create a modular and efficient system. Here's how each principle was implemented:

- **Encapsulation** üíä  
  In the code, data related to volunteers, resources, and tasks is stored in private attributes within classes like `Volunteer`, `Resource`, and `Task`. These private attributes are accessed and modified only through getter and setter methods, ensuring the integrity of the data. For example, the `Resource` class ensures that the quantity of items cannot be set to a negative value, protecting the data from invalid inputs.

- **Abstraction** üóÑÔ∏è  
  Complex operations are abstracted into separate classes like `VolunteerManager`, `ResourceManager`, and `TaskManager`. For instance, when adding a new volunteer, the user simply selects the "Manage Volunteers" option, and the `VolunteerManager` class handles the creation and storage of the volunteer. Users interact with a straightforward menu system, while the internal complexities of data processing are hidden.

- **Inheritance** üß¨  
  A base class `User` is used to define common properties such as `name`, `contact`, and `address`. The `Volunteer` class inherits from `User`, reducing redundant code and enabling shared methods to be reused. This structure allows for easy future expansion, such as adding other user roles like coordinators or responders.

- **Polymorphism** üìë  
  Polymorphism is utilized through overridden methods like `toString()`. For example, the `Volunteer` class overrides the `toString()` method to return detailed information about the volunteer, while the `Resource` class provides a different representation for its objects. This makes it easier to display relevant information based on the object type, improving user interaction.

### Integration with SDG üåç

  <img src="https://github.com/yshlae/ResQnect/blob/main/images/SDG%20Goal%2011.png" alt="SDG Goal 11" width="1000">
</div>

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** emphasizes creating safe, resilient, and inclusive communities, and **ResQnect** directly contributes to this goal. The system improves preparedness by enabling local governments and organizations to track and manage critical resources such as food, water, and medical supplies, ensuring readiness for emergencies. It facilitates an efficient response by streamlining the assignment of tasks to volunteers, reducing delays in relief operations. This also supports recovery efforts by providing tools to monitor and track the completion of disaster response activities, ensuring affected communities receive timely support. Moreover, the system promotes resilience by generating detailed reports that analyze response times and resource usage, which can be used to improve future disaster preparedness strategies.

### Running the Program üíª

To run the **ResQnect** system, follow these steps for a smooth experience:

---

## 1. Setup and Run the Program  

1. **Save the Code**  
   Clone or download the project files into a single directory.  
   Ensure the files include the Java source files (e.g., `Volunteer.java`, `Resource.java`, `Task.java`, `Main.java`).  

2. **Compile the Program**  
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.  
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are stored.  
   - Compile all Java files using the command:  
     ```bash  
     javac *.java  
     ```  

3. **Run the Program**  
   - Start the system by running the main file:  
     ```bash  
     java Main  
     ```  
---

## 2. Main Menu  

When the program starts, the main menu will be displayed, offering the following options:  

1. Volunteer Management  
2. Resource Management  
3. Task Assignment  
4. Disaster Response Tracker  
5. Response Time Reports  
6. Exit  

Enter the corresponding number to access the desired functionality.  

---

## 3. Volunteer Management: Adding a New Volunteer  

- Choose **1. Volunteer Management** from the main menu.  
- The system will prompt you to:  
  - Enter the **name** of the volunteer.  
  - Specify the **type** of volunteer (e.g., Medical, Rescue, or General).  
  - Indicate the volunteer‚Äôs **availability** (e.g., Available or Unavailable).  
- After inputting the details, the system will save the volunteer information for future use.  

---

## 4. Resource Management: Adding Resources  

- Select **2. Resource Management** from the main menu.  
- The system will prompt you to add critical disaster response resources:  
  - Enter details such as the quantity of **food**, **water**, or **medical supplies**.  
- Resource data will be stored securely and accessed when needed during disaster management.  

---
